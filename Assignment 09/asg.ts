// Q:09 Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// In this program i stored a poet name in a variable and i printed the famous quote of his poet...
let poet = "Eleanor Roosevelt";
let famousQuote = `"The future belongs to those who believes in the beauty of their dreams".`;
console.log(`${poet} once said, ${famousQuote}`);

// In this program i stored my name in a variable and then i printed my name in different cases. like (lower,upper,and tile case)...
let person = "Abdul AAhad";
console.log(person.toLocaleLowerCase());
console.log(person.toLocaleUpperCase());
console.log(person)
