// Q:11 Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names = ["Ahmed", "Zain" , "Faraz", "Shanza", "Matraba", "Shifa"];
console.log(`Hello ${names[0]} I hope you are doing well please don't forget to learn typescript today...`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[1]} I hope you are doing well please don't forget to learn typescript today...`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[2]} I hope you are doing well please don't forget to learn typescript today...`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[3]} I hope you are doing well please don't forget to learn typescript today...`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[4]} I hope you are doing well please don't forget to learn typescript today...`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[5]} I hope you are doing well please don't forget to learn typescript today...`);
