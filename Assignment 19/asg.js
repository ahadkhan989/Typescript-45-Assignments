// Q:19 Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
const listOfCities = ["Khipro", "Hyderabad", "Jamsabad", "Samaro", "Lahore", "Sukkar"];
console.log("\nList of Cities\n");
for (let list = 0; list < listOfCities.length; list++) {
    console.log(listOfCities[list]);
}
