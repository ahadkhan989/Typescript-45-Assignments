// Q:42 Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// 
function show_magicians(magicians:string[]){
    magicians.forEach(name => console.log(name));
}

// Define a function to make changes
function make_great(magicians:string[]){
    return magicians.map(name => `The great ${name}`)
}

// Defining an Array of magicians name
let magician_names = ["AAhad", "Ali", "Abdullah", "Shanza"]

// Call the function make_great() within variable to modify magicians names
let great_magicians = make_great(magician_names);

// Call show magicians that show modified list of magicians 
show_magicians(great_magicians);
